## SLY (Sly Lex Yacc)

### PARSER
SLY uses a parsing technique known as LR-parsing or shift-reduce parsing. LR parsing is a bottom up technique that tries to recognize the right-hand-side of various grammar rules. Whenever a valid right-hand-side is found in the input, the appropriate action method is triggered and the grammar symbols on right hand side are replaced by the grammar symbol on the left-hand-side.
